<h3>The Anonymous Auditor's Code</h3>
<p>
We don't trust words. We trust code, hashes, and on-chain footprints.<br>
Every audit is a criminal investigation, not a financial report.

## 🧬 THE 4-LEVEL PHILOSOPHY

Our system is built as a cascade of filters: from broad context to molecular code dissection.

| Level | Role (Archetype) | Goal | Unique Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🟢 **EASY** | **Detective** | Tell a story in plain English. Find the motive and main clues. | *"Case #1225", "Crime Scene", "Theories"* |
| 🔵 **PRO** | **Forensic Expert** | Autopsy the code. Find the cause of death (vulnerabilities) and technical anomalies. | *Code Review, CVE, Macro-Context* |
| 🟣 **RESEARCH** | **Intelligence (Intel)** | Build a database. 3000 links → 200 facts. Cent-level precision. | *Arkham, Glassnode, CSV Exports* |
| 🟡 **SUMMARY** | **Judge** | Deliver the verdict. Data cross-check and visualization for C-Level. | *Dashboard, Charts, Issues Log* |

## 🟢 LEVEL 1: EASY MODE (INVESTIGATION)
> *"Imagine the bank is printing money in the basement..."*

We strip away complex jargon. We explain the essence.
*   **Scenario:** The audit is written like a detective story. We have "Suspects" (devs), "Victims" (investors), and "Evidence".
*   **Criteria:**
    *   Who holds the keys?
    *   Can they mint a trillion tokens?
    *   Is there a >99% sell tax (Honeypot)?
*   **Outcome:** Risk Score (1-10) and a clear conclusion (SCAM / GEM).

---

## 🔵 LEVEL 2: PRO MODE (AUTOPSY)
> *"Code doesn't lie. People do."*

This is where heavy AI artillery and technical analysis come in.
*   **Macro-Context:** How the Fed, network upgrades (Fusaka, Pectra), and global trends affect the asset.
*   **Code Forensic:**
    *   `Reentrancy` (Re-entry attacks).
    *   `Hidden Mint` (Hidden emission).
    *   `Blacklist functions` (Wallet censorship).
*   **On-Chain Footprints:** Where did presale funds go? Was Tornado Cash used?

---

## 🟣 LEVEL 3: RESEARCH (INTELLIGENCE)
> *"If a fact isn't on the blockchain, it doesn't exist."*

The deepest and most labor-intensive stage.
*   **Big Data:** Analysis of 1000-3000 sources. Noise filtering.
*   **Tools:**
    *   🔍 **Arkham Intelligence:** Who transferred money to whom.
    *   📊 **Glassnode:** Exchange flows (CEX Inflow/Outflow).
    *   📝 **Etherscan:** Checking every transaction.
*   **Requirement:** Every statement must have a link. (Example: *"Bought for $199.5M"* — link to TX).

---

## 🟡 LEVEL 4: SUMMARY (TRIBUNAL)
> *"The Judge needs one page to strike the gavel."*

Consolidation of all data into a single control panel.
1.  **Cross-Check (Cross-Examination):** The script verifies data from EASY, PRO, and RESEARCH. If numbers don't match — alarm 🚨.
2.  **Visuals:** Automatic generation of charts (Pie Charts, Bar Charts).
3.  **Database:** Creation of `glb_issues_summary.csv` — a database of all found issues for machine analysis.
4.  **Verdict:** Strategic decision for the DAO.
